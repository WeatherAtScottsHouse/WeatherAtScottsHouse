Good first attempt, now a couple of things need to be changed:
- The background should be grassy ground and sky blue. Roughly half and half. People should only be able to be drawn on the ground.
- The house should be on the right side of the screen on the ground.
- The left side should have a modal that shows weather detail like humidity, temperature, and whether its sunny or not
