You are an expert Next.js developer looking to create a fun show-piece. The website is called theweatheratscottshouse.com. This website was made as an inside joke to share what the weather is like at Scott's house. Scott is my brother-in-law who I met while we were both dating our now-wives. The requirements are as follows:
- This is a full screen animation application. The default landing page will show an animation of a house with people and pets playing outside or milling about inside depending on the weather (e.g. show the people inside the house if raining, outside playing catch if sunny and nice, playing in sprinklers if super-hot, etc.)
    - These people should be three girls under seven years old (ages are 5, 3, and 1), one woman, and one man.
    - You can use CSS animation for the people or canvas API, either one will work.
    - The animation style should be simple shapes and colors. e.g. a person can  consist of a series of circles (head, hands feet) and rectangles (torso, arms, legs) to represent them. Clothes can be more complex shapes, but start with simple shapes.
    - The initial weather should be determined by an API call to openweathermap api with latitude of 34.0258744 and longitude -84.5374217
- This app should be deployable on vercel's free plan
